# SciOps Demo Workflow Docker[Legacy]

***Drew Yang @ DataJoint*** | ***2021.10.05***

## Now this repo is included in [SciOps Demo Workflow](https://github.com/vathes/sciops-demo-workflow-1)

## Prerequisite
Build the base [MATLAB image](https://github.com/Yambottle/matlab) at first.
- Installer has to be an offline installer that includes all the toolboxes
- Wasn't ablt to activate licenses using the activation binary, but was able to directly mount license file in `~/MATLAB/licenses/` and skip the activation.

> The required image is referenced from [MATLAB image - Raphael Guzman](https://github.com/guzman-raphael/matlab)
